The combination of basic logic operators is a powerful tool in computing.
Any statement that can be formulated in terms of propositional logic, can be implemented using the basic logic operators. 
In order to find a way to implement a statement, a commonly used method is the generation of a \textit{truth table}.
These truth tabels can also be transformed in what is called a \textit{K-Map}.
Expressed in this particular form, statements for a logic output can be written down in a straightforward way. 
By finding rectangular cells of ones or zeros in a K-Map, it is possible to find a statement for a logic output.
\section*{Exercises}
\begin{aufgabe}
    Write down the truth-table for an OR-gate that maps the inputs $A$ and $B$ to the output $Q$. 
    Consecutively, write down a $2x2$ grid, with the columns representing $A=0$ and $A=1$ as well as the rows representing $B=0$ and $B=1$.
    Take a different color of pen and circle rectangular cells of ones in this K-Map. 
    You will end up with two rectangular cells, both representing the output $Q=1$.
    The output of this logic function can now be expressed as $Q$ is true if either the prerequisites for circle 1 or circle 2 are fullfilled. 
    Take a look at which prerequisite is stable for a given rectangular cell and which one doesn't have an influence. 
    All prerequisites that are constant for a given rectangular cell have to be joined by an AND-gate.
    This is how you can come up with an expression for rectangular cell. 
    Joining n individual cells is done by using an OR-gate.
    You should now see, that looking at the K-Map and the rectangular cells, the circled cells reproduce the statement of $Q = A or B$
\end{aufgabe}
\begin{aufgabe}
    Take a look at table \ref{fig:ABC}. 
    Find all rectangular cells.
    You will now also see, that there is no way of expressing rectangular cells with an amount of cells, that is not divisible by $2^n$.
    Write down the boolean-statment that is represented by the given K-Map.\\

\begin{aufgabe}
    A K-Map usually only represents the statement of a single output. 
    When confronted with multiple outputs as seen in table \ref{fig:adder}, one will have to create a K-Map for each output.
    Thus, each output is represented by an individual equation, resulting in an individual circuit. 
    Write down the K-Maps for the truth table in table \ref{fig:adder}.
